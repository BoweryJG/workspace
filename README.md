## Supabase Integration

The application connects to a Supabase database to fetch and manage AI prompts. The database contains:

This feature requires a separate service called **The Hundred** which provides
additional data for report generation. Configure the following API endpoint and
keys in your environment variables:

- `VITE_THE_HUNDRED_API_KEY` - API key for authenticating requests
- Example endpoints include `/players` for roster data and `/stats` for
  performance statistics.
